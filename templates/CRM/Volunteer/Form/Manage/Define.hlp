    <p>Use this form to define the number of volunteers needed for each role and time slot.
    The first slot listed is a default 'flexible' slot (for volunteers who are available at any time for any role).
    For each additional slot, you will select a role, set the number of volunteers needed, set a start date and time,
    and indicate the duration in minutes. If you want to include a Sign Up button on the event information page, check
    the 'Visible' column for at least one of the slots ('Visible' slots will be available on the public signup form).</p>
    <p> If this is a new type of volunteer project, you may need to create additional volunteer roles first from
    <a href=%1>Administer > System Settings > Option Groups > Volunteer Role</a>.
